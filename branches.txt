while developing a application need to create three types of branches in any repository(git hub)
1. dev branch: by using this branch we can develop the code and we can test the code several times , we can modify several times without rising PR.
2. UAT (user acceptance test)branch: by using this repository user(client) can test the code after developing
3. master branch : this branch is a final branch for any application code to deploy the application
this line is checking the update from pull command
